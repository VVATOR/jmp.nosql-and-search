Task 1: Backend Database Migration
===================================

**Cost**: 50 points.

Move one of your pet applications/mentoring projects with DAO and simple CRUD to MongoDB.
In case you don't have such projects you can use the sample project attached ([ticket-booking.zip](statics/ticket-booking.zip))

Install MongoDB and use the corresponding Java driver.

* Define the data model for MongoDB (direct table-collection mapping is not the best idea).
* Write data migration job (via SQL and MongoDriver operations).
* Use an aggregation mechanism to get grouped results from the database.
* (Optional) Run this job in one transaction for the SQL database and in one multi-document transaction for MongoDB.
* (Optional) Use appropriate indices to improve query performance.
* (Optional) Make a replica set with 1 primary and 2 secondary nodes, and execute your tests/client code over the MongoDB cluster.
