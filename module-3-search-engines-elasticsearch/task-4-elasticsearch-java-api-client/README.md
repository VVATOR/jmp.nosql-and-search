## Elasticsearch Practical Tasks

## Task 4 - Implement Java API Client for retrieval of employees info (20 Points)

[Java API Client](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-api-client/current/introduction.html)

    Perform the same tasks as for Java Low REST Client.
    Note! You should use Java API Client, not the deprecated High Level Rest Client. They are similar, so don't mistake one for the other.
    What difficulties have you faced comparing to Java Low REST client?
